** Installation

** Usage

** Roadmap
*** DONE Define Common
Define the interfaces which the Server and the Client will rely on the
communication.
**** DONE Define ClientPromise
**** DONE Define SessionMaker

*** PROJ Make the Server
Implement the Server that the professor will execute.
**** DONE Make tests for Question
+ [X] Make test for isCorrectAnswer
  - [X] If the integer is the correct answer, then return True
  - [X] Else return False
+ [X] Make getQuestion
  Returns a multiline string as:
    #+begin_src python
return """ Question
           - [0]: Choice 0
           - [1]: Choice 1
           - [2]: Choice 2
           [ ... ]
"""
    #+end_src
+ [X] Make static parseLine
  - [X] Test for a correct string with 3 choice
  - [X] Test a correct string with 4 choices
  - [X] Test an incorrect string with 1 choice
  - [X] Test an unparsable string
  - [X] Test an incorrect string with "Question;Correct choice"

**** DONE Make Question
+ [X] Make question final
+ [X] Make the fields
+ [X] Make the methods
+ [X] Make the static function parseLine, that given a question
  line parses a String
  
**** DONE Make tests for UserSession
+ [X] Test Creation of UserSession: integers are 0 and 0,
  and different creations the UserSession are equal.
+ [X] Test nextQuestionCorrect: both integers are summed 1 and 1.
+ [X] Test nextQuestion: only the actual question is incremented.
  
**** DONE Make UserSession
+ [X] Make the UserSession final: this will let the compiler make
  the necessary optimizations.
+ [X] Make the fields
+ [X] Make the methods
  
**** TODO Make tests for SessionMakerImpl
+ [X] Test newSession:
  - [X] Adds an entry to users, with the passes Id and a new UserSession.
  - [X] Test that this behavior with more than one user.
  - [X] Test that a student that tries to create a session for the second time does not break anything.
  - [X] Adds an entry to the client map.
    
+ [ ] Test answerQuestion
  - [ ] test that an answer calls:
    + [ ] The corresponding ~Question~ with ~isCorrectAnswer~. Make an interface to test
      this.
    + [ ] The corresponding ~UserSession~ calls ~nextQuestionCorrect~ if ~isCorrectAnswer~ is
      ~True~, and ~nextQuestion~ if ~isCorrectAnswer~ is ~False~.
+ [ ] Test ~hasNext~
  - [ ] Test that it calls
    + [ ] ~UserSession.getActualAnswer~ is called
  - [ ] Returns that the ~actualQuestion~ is smaller than ~question~
+ [ ] Test ~next~
  - [ ] Returns a ~Question~
  - [ ] Throws an error if the ~Question~ does not exist
+ [ ] Test ~finishExam~.
  - [ ] Test that calls all finishExam that are in the map, even if some fail
    with a remote exception.
+ [ ] Test ~startExam~: It calls all ~ClientPromise.startExam~.

**** TODO Implement SessionMakerImpl
+ [ ] ~answerQuestion~
+ [X] ~newSession~
+ [ ] ~hasNext~
+ [ ] ~next~
+ [ ] ~finishExam~


**** TODO Test Professor
First search if you can use mockito to mock IO by user.
+ [ ] Test this pseudocode
  #+begin_src 
main = do
    inputfile, outputfile <- args
    session <- SessionMaker $ parseQuestion inputfile
    startExam <- readLn
    finishTheExam <- readLn
    finishExam outputfile session
  #+end_src
**** TODO Implement Professor

*** DONE Make Client
**** DONE Make Client Promise Test
+ [X] ~finishExam~ sets:
  - [X] correctAnswers
  - [X] totalQuestions
  - [X] finishExam = true
+ [X] ~startExam~ calls:
  + [X] ~notifyAll~
  + [X] sets ~startExam~ to ~true~
    
    
**** DONE Make Client Promise
+ [X] make ~finishExam~
+ [X] make ~startExam~
  
**** DONE Make Student executable
Test the calls of this pseudocode:
#+begin_src 
main = do
        id <- readLn
        client <- ClientPromise
        sessionMaker.newSession(id, client)
        while sessionMaker.hasNext(id):
            question <- sessionMaker.next(id)
            printLn $ question
            answer <- readLn
            sessionMaker.answerQuestion(id, answer)
#+end_src

** Technologies used
- For the executable project, we used the technologies:
  + Java 1.8
  + Java RMI

- For the tests, we used:
  + JUnit 5
  + Mockito
    

- For the documentation, we used the Emacs org-mode:
  + org-mode
  + plantUML
  We recommend to use Doom Emacs or Spacemacs for this.
